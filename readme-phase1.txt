I removed the initial video after the Phase 1 submission date passed, since it was out of date very quickly. Now that I realize the project is being evaluated/graded now as opposed to then, I have added a newer more up-to-date video reflecting the current state of the project (as of July 22nd - or more accurately July 16th when I last worked on it before the labs took over my time).

I have also added the diagram-enhanced explanatory slides, and the report I submitted in the Phase 1 CourseSpaces is also reproduced here.

All these files are prefixed "z_" to make sure they are grouped together at the bottom of the directory.
